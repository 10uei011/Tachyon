\section{Introduction}

JavaScript is a dynamically typed functional language.
The ECMAScript version 5 document \cite{ECMAScript09}
is the latest specification of the language.

Push to make JavaScript web applications a dominant platform, move desktop
applications on the web. Quest for performance.

Optimization of dynamic languages is a difficult problem. Much work remains
to be done. Need for an open, easy to use research and experimentation platform.

Distinguishing features of Tachyon: meta-circular. Almost entirely in JavaScript,
contains very little C code. Back-end written from scratch, very little
external depencencies, complete control over entire compilation pipeline.
Use of SSA-based IR, JS extensions using "Inline IR". Tachyon is a pure JIT.
