/**
@fileOverview
This file includes wrapper code for low-level, raw memory access, which is
necessary for bootstrapping.
<br><br>
When running under D8, these functions will be calling external C/C++ host
functions to do their work, and pointers will be represented as ordinary
JavaScript number values (doubles).
<br><br>
In fully bootstrapped mode, however, the VM will recognize calls to these
functions and replace them by native instructions directly. Pointers will then
be represented as unsigned integers which machine instructions can operate on
directly.
