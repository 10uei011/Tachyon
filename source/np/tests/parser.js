// TODO: test automatic semicolon insertion, multiple cases

{ 1 2 } 3
is not a valid sentence in the ECMAScript grammar, even with the automatic
semicolon insertion rules. In contrast, the source
{ 1 
2 } 3
is also not a valid ECMAScript sentence, but is transformed by automatic
semicolon insertion into the following:
{ 1 
;2 ;} 3;
which is a valid ECMAScript sentence.


for (a; b 
)

is not a valid ECMAScript sentence and is not altered by automatic semicolon
insertion because the semicolon is needed for the header of a for statement.
Automatic semicolon insertion never inserts one of the two semicolons in the
header of a for statement


The source
return 
a + b
is transformed by automatic semicolon insertion into the following:
return; 
a + b;


The source
a = b 
++c
is transformed by automatic semicolon insertion into the following:
a = b; 
++c;


The source
if (a > b) 
else c = d
is not a valid ECMAScript sentence and is not altered by automatic semicolon
insertion before the else token, even though no production of the grammar
applies at that point, because an automatically inserted semicolon would then
be parsed as an empty statement.


The source
a = b + c 
(d + e).print()
is not transformed by automatic semicolon insertion, because the parenthesised
expression that begins the second line can be interpreted as an argument list
for a function call:
a = b + c(d + e).print()
